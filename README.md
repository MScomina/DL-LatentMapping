# Deep Learning Project
Project for the course "Deep Learning" - UniTS.

## Description
The project is an expansion on the paper [Relative representations enable zero-shot latent space communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15430), more specifically on the possibility of finding the same relative representation between different architectures.
